# Square

Write a constructor function called `Square` that receives an argument called `side` and initializes an attribute with the same name.

Add a method `perimeter` that calculates the perimeter of the square.

Add a method `area` that calculates the area of the square.

```javascript
var s1 = new Square(5);
s1.perimeter(); // 20
s1.area(); // 25
```
