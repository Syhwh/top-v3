# Harmonic Sum

Write a function called `harmonicSum` that calculates the harmonic sum of n. The harmonic sum is the sum of reciprocals of the positive integers.

**Note:** Use recursion to solve this exercise.

```javascript
harmonicSum(1); // 1
harmonicSum(2); // 1 + 1/2 = 1.5
harmonicSum(3); // 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 1.833333
```
