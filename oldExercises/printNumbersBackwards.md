# Print Numbers Backwards

Write a function called `printNumsBackwards` that receives a number and prints all the numbers from the number to 1. Print each number in a new line.

**Note:** You have to use recursion to solve this exercise.

```javascript
printNumsBackwards(10); // prints 10 to 1
printNumsBackwards(500); // prints 500 to 1
```
