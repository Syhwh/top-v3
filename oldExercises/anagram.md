# Anagram

Write a function called `anagram` that receives two strings and returns true if the strings are anagrams, false otherwise. Two words are anagrams if one of them has exactly same characters as that of the another word.

```javascript
anagram("anagram", "nagaram"); // true
anagram("hello", "world"); // false
```
