# Circle

Write a constructor function called `Circle` that receives an argument called `radius` and initializes an attribute with the same name.

Add a method called `circunference` that returns the circunference of the circle.

Add a method called `area` that returns the area of the circle.

```javascript
var circle = new Circle(2);
circle.circunference(); // 2 * r * Pi
circle.area(); // Pi * r^2
```
