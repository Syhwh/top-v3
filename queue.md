# Queue

Write a constructor function called `Queue` with no arguments. It should initialize three attributes:

* `head` with `null`
* `tail` with `null`
* `size` with `0`

The methods that you will implement are:

* `enqueue`
* `dequeue`
* `size`

```javascript
var queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(4);
queue.dequeue(); // returns the first element of the queue
queue.size(); // returns the size of the queue
```
